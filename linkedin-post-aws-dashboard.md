# LinkedIn Post - AWS Services Dashboard

🚀 **New Project: AWS Services Dashboard**

Excited to share my latest experiment in AI-assisted development - a real-time AWS service discovery and visualization platform built entirely with Claude Code.

**The Challenge:** Cloud architects and engineering teams need instant visibility into AWS service availability across regions and accounts. Traditional approaches involve manual documentation checks or running CLI commands across multiple environments.

**The Solution:** A serverless dashboard that provides real-time insights into your AWS infrastructure footprint - which services are deployed where, regional distribution patterns, and infrastructure evolution over time.

🔧 **Built with:** React 18, AWS Lambda, EventBridge, S3, CloudFront, Terraform
📊 **Live Demo:** https://aws-services.synepho.com

**Key Learning:** The success came from strategic upfront planning and modular architecture design. When working with AI assistants on complex projects, resist the urge to jump straight to code. Breaking the project into four focused repositories - frontend, data collection, reporting, and infrastructure - made each component manageable for AI-assisted development.

This continues my ongoing experimentation with AI development tools and their real-world applications in solving practical engineering challenges.

**Alternative Professional Version:**

Sharing insights from a recent project: building a real-time AWS service discovery platform entirely through AI-assisted development.

**The Challenge**
Engineering teams designing AWS solutions need quick answers: "Is service X available in region Y?" Manual documentation checks are time-consuming and error-prone.

**The Approach**
Leveraged serverless architecture (Lambda, EventBridge, S3) with modular design across four independent repositories. Each component had a focused responsibility, making AI-assisted development manageable and effective.

**Key Takeaway**
Strategic planning matters more than ever with AI tools. Spending time on architecture and clear component boundaries enabled smooth development sessions and resulted in a maintainable, production-ready system.
