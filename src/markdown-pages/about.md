# <center> About Me <center>

Hello my name is John, I am a loving husband to my beatiful wife Michelle and a proud "Girl Dad" to my daughter Mia. When I am not busy spending time with my family and frieds, you can find me outside working on my lawn or in my CrossFit Box working on my deadlifts.

Professionally I have over 20 years’ experience working in IT where I have a true passion for building high-performing Systems, Teams and Processes. At present I am an IT Executive at a market leading Cloud Communications company, where I lead a global team of talented directors and engineers. When I am not working, I am an <u>"engineer at heart"</u> writing code, working on an app or just learning a new tech skill. Learning and embracing change are key values I hold in both my professional and personal life. Whether it is entering a CrossFit gym for the first time or working with the latest React framework, <u>set your goal, go for it</u> and just enjoy the process!

For those intersted and curious about my domain name **SYNEPHO** and its meaning. It is my phonetic spelling of the Greek word for Cloud "σύννεφο" and aligns with my affinity for Cloud computing and technologies.
