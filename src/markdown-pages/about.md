# <center> About Me <center>

Hello my name is John, I am a loving husband to my beatiful wife Michelle and a proud "Girl Dad" to my daughter Mia. When I am not busy spending time with my family and frieds, you can find me outside working on my lawn or in my CrossFit Box working on my deadlifts.

Professionally I have over 20 years’ experience working in IT where I have a true passion for building high-performing Systems, Teams and Processes. At present I am an IT Executive at a market leading Cloud Communications company, where I lead a global team of talented directors and engineers. When I am not working at my day job, I am a "techie at heart" where enjoy writing code, working on an app or just learning a new skill. Learning and embracing change are key values I hold in both my professional and personal life. Whether it is entering a CrossFit gym for the first time or working with the latest React framework, keep your eye on the goal and enjoy the process!

For those intersted and curious about my domain name **SYNEPHO** and its meaning. It is my phonetic spelling of the Greek word for Cloud "σύννεφο" and aligns with my affinity for Cloud computing technologies.
