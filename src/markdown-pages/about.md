# <center> About Me <center>

Greetings!

I'm John, a devoted husband to my wonderful wife Michelle and a proud "Girl Dad" to my daughter Mia. When I'm not immersed in quality time with family and friends, you'll likely find me outdoors tending to my lawn or at my CrossFit Box, dedicatedly perfecting my deadlifts.

In the professional realm, I boast over two decades of experience in IT, where I harbor a genuine passion for crafting high-performing systems, teams, and processes. Currently, I serve as an IT Executive at a leading Cloud Communications company, steering a global team of skilled directors and engineers. Beyond the confines of my day job, I'm inherently a "techie at heart," finding joy in coding, app development, or simply acquiring new skills. Embracing change and fostering a love for learning are values that resonate both in my personal and professional spheres. Whether stepping into a CrossFit gym for the first time or delving into the intricacies of the latest React framework, I believe in keeping focused on the goal and relishing the journey.

For those intrigued by my domain name, **SYNEPHO**, and its significance—it's a phonetic rendition of the Greek word for Cloud, "σύννεφο," reflecting my deep connection with Cloud computing technologies.
