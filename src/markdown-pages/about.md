# About Me

## Personal Life

Greetings! I'm John, a devoted husband to my wonderful wife Michelle and a proud "Girl Dad" to my daughter Mia. When I'm not spending quality time with family and friends, you'll find me outdoors tending to my lawn or at my CrossFit box, dedicatedly perfecting my deadlifts.

## Professional Journey

With over two decades in IT leadership, I have a genuine passion for building high-performing systems, teams, and processes. Currently, I serve as an IT Executive at a leading Cloud Communications company, where I guide a global team of talented directors and engineers.

### What Drives Me

Beyond my executive role, I'm a "techie at heart" who finds joy in:

- **Hands-on Development**: Building applications and experimenting with new frameworks
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying current with emerging technologies and methodologies  
- **Team Building**: Developing people and fostering collaborative, high-performance cultures
- **Innovation**: Finding creative solutions to complex technical and business challenges

## Philosophy

Embracing change and fostering a love for learning are core values that guide both my personal and professional life. Whether stepping into a CrossFit gym for the first time or diving deep into the latest React framework, I believe in staying focused on the goal while relishing the journey.

## About SYNEPHO

Curious about my domain name? **SYNEPHO** is a phonetic rendition of the Greek word for Cloud, "σύννεφο," reflecting my deep connection with cloud computing technologies and my commitment to helping organizations leverage the power of the cloud.
