              Ever wonder how a holiday coding challenge could lead to
              revolutionizing your work processes? That's exactly what happened
              to me this December, and I'm excited to share how my exploration
              of AI assistants evolved from solving puzzles to building
              production-ready cloud infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h2>The Holiday Challenge That Started It All</h2>

            <p>
              It all began with Advent of Code, a series of daily programming
              challenges that pop up every December. While my colleagues were
              grinding through the problems the traditional way, I decided to
              take a different approach. Why not use this as an opportunity to
              evaluate various Large Language Models (LLMs) and coding
              assistants? It was the perfect testing ground — contained problems
              with clear success criteria, but enough complexity to really push
              these AI tools to their limits.
            </p>

            <h2>From Puzzle Solving to Practical Applications</h2>

            <p>
              As I worked through the Advent of Code challenges with different
              AI assistants, something interesting happened. I started seeing
              patterns in how these tools could help beyond just solving
              puzzles. The way they approached problems, suggested
              optimizations, and explained their thinking got me wondering:
              "Could this help with my actual work as a Cloud Engineer?"
            </p>

            <p>
              That's when it hit me — I had this nagging issue with AWS Health
              alerts that needed solving. You know, those JSON notifications
              that look like they were written by robots, for robots? What if I
              could apply what I learned from my AI coding challenge experiments
              to a real-world problem?
            </p>

            <h2>Meet My AI Pair Programmer</h2>

            <p>
              Enter Claude, an AI assistant that turned out to be way more than
              just another chatbot. While most people think of AI tools as
              glorified spell-checkers or email drafters, I decided to push the
              boundaries and see if it could hang with some serious cloud
              infrastructure work.
            </p>

            <h3>The Project's Evolution</h3>

            <p>
              What started as "I just want better-looking notifications" quickly
              turned into:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>"Hey, why not manage this properly with Terraform?"</li>
              <li>
                "Well, if we're using Terraform, we should have a proper CI/CD
                pipeline…"
              </li>
              <li>
                "And if we're doing CI/CD, we might as well do it right with
                GitHub Actions…"
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Before I knew it, I was building a full-fledged infrastructure
              pipeline, with Claude suggesting improvements I hadn't even
              thought of!
            </p>

            <h2>The Connection Between Puzzles and Production</h2>

            <p>
              Looking back, the progression makes perfect sense. Advent of Code
              taught me:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>How to effectively prompt AI assistants</li>
              <li>When to trust their suggestions and when to be skeptical</li>
              <li>How to iterate on solutions with AI help</li>
              <li>
                The importance of understanding the code, not just accepting it
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              These lessons proved invaluable when tackling my AWS Health
              notifications project. The same patterns of problem decomposition,
              solution iteration, and code review that worked for puzzle-solving
              translated perfectly to building production infrastructure.
            </p>

            <h2>The Cool Stuff We Built</h2>

            <p>The end result? A pretty sweet setup that:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Catches AWS Health Events (you know, the important stuff)</li>
              <li>
                Makes them actually readable for humans (revolutionary, I know!)
              </li>
              <li>Deploys everything through a proper CI/CD pipeline</li>
              <li>
                Keeps everything in check with version control and approval
                processes
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>
              Working with an AI Partner: The Good, The Better, and The
              Surprising
            </h2>

            <h3>The Good</h3>

            <p>
              Claude turned out to be like that really detail-oriented colleague
              who never gets tired. Every time I hit a wall with an error
              message, it was like:
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                <strong>Me:</strong> "Help, GitHub Actions is complaining about
                something…"
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Claude:</strong> "Ah, let me help you fix that and
                explain why it happened…"
              </p>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Better</h3>

            <p>
              The documentation game was <strong>STRONG</strong>. You know how
              developers (myself included) usually treat documentation as an
              afterthought? Claude was that voice of reason:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>"Hey, shouldn't we write a proper README for this?"</li>
              <li>"How about a better commit message than 'fixed stuff'?"</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Surprising</h3>

            <p>
              Every time we got warnings about deprecated features or needed
              updates, Claude was on it faster than I could Google the issue.
              When GitHub warned us about artifact version deprecation or Ubuntu
              runner updates, solutions were just a prompt away.
            </p>

            <h2>What I Actually Built</h2>

            <p>For those interested in the technical bits, the system:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>Monitors AWS Health Events (because uptime is king)</li>
              <li>
                Formats notifications so they don't look like computer vomit
              </li>
              <li>
                Uses Terraform for infrastructure management (because clicking
                in consoles is so 2010)
              </li>
              <li>
                Runs everything through GitHub Actions with proper checks and
                balances
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

            <p>Here's the real talk:</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                AI isn't going to replace us Cloud Engineers or Developers
                anytime soon
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>BUT…</strong> it's an incredibly powerful tool when used
                right
              </li>
              <li>
                Always review the code (seriously, don't just copy-paste
                blindly)
              </li>
              <li>
                The future of cloud infrastructure work might be a lot more
                interesting with AI assistants in our toolkit
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>What's Next?</h2>

            <p>
              Claude suggested some pretty interesting improvements I might
              tackle next:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>Cost estimation (because budgets matter, ask your CFO)</li>
              <li>
                Slack notifications (because who doesn't love more
                notifications?)
              </li>
              <li>
                Multi-environment support (because production should be special)
              </li>
              <li>
                Drift detection (because infrastructure has a mind of its own
                sometimes)
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

            <p>
              What started as a fun holiday coding challenge with AI assistants
              has evolved into a new way of approaching cloud infrastructure
              development. You can check out the results of this journey in my
              <a
                href="https://github.com/jxman"
                target="_blank"
                rel="noopener noreferrer"
              >
                GitHub repository
              </a>
              , where I've documented everything from the initial problem to the
              final solution.
            </p>

            <p>
              <strong>Remember:</strong> AI is like a really knowledgeable
              intern — great at helping out and suggesting ideas, but you still
              need to be the one making the final calls!
            </p>

            <h2>A Meta Twist</h2>

            <p>
              Here's a fun fact to wrap things up: This entire article was
              crafted with the help of Claude, the same AI assistant that helped
              build the project it describes. I provided the context,
              experiences, and direction, while Claude helped structure and
              articulate the story. It's a perfect example of how AI can help
              with both technical and creative tasks when used as a
              collaborative tool.
            </p>
